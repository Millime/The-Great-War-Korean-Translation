# LAND DOCTRINES

ww1_landdoctrine:0 "대규모 돌격"
ww1_landdoctrine_desc:0 “예전만 하더라도 병사들은 전열을 형성하고 발포를 하기 전까진 전장으로 느릿느릿 진군하였다. 그러나 이제는 맥심 기관총이 거의 전 세계 군대에서 사용되고 있기에, 옛 방식은 우리 병사들을 도축하는 최고의 방법이나 다름없다. 우리 장군들은 수적우위를 활용한 재빠른 돌격으로 적 방어를 뚫어야 된다고 확신한다!”

ww1_directfire:0 "참호 대대"
ww1_directfire_desc:0 "기관총은 무서운 무기이지만, 튼튼히 방호될 때 더욱 무서워 진다는 것이 경험으로 증명되었다. 참호가 적합해 보이며, 참호 공사에 특화된 공병 대대로 공사에 박차야 한다. 참호의 행렬로 전방을 뒤덮을 것이다!"

ww1_rifle_ammo:0 "소총수 으뜸"
ww1_rifle_ammo_desc:0 "오늘날 전쟁에서 기관총이 무서운 무기이긴 하나. 여전히 소총수는 더 흔하고, 편성과 장비를 더 쉽게 할 수 있으며, 무엇보다 맥심 사수보다 더 기동성이 있다. 핵심 병력에 집중함으로 우리는 전투에서 위치 선정 및 속도에서의 이점을 누릴 것이며, 또한 우리의 가장 흔한 보병이 최고급임을 보장할 수 있게 된다."

ww1_mg_ammo:0 "기관총 부대"
ww1_mg_ammo_desc:0 "The Heavy Machine Guns- mostly Maxims- we have in use are, despite their primacy, operated inefficiently. Any MG needs 3 people- a gunner, a loader to keep the ammunition flowing, and a spotter to call targets, support the weapon with rifle or pistol fire, and direct the MG's fire. Training support gunners in all 3 of these roles ensures a great supply of trained crews, and ensures anyone knocked out in battle can be replaced."

ww1_long_march:0 "기동 진지"
ww1_long_march_desc:0 "When the enemy's trench has finally been emptied and overrun, it is imperative that we be able to exploit our advantage! Several of our attacks fail simply because by the time we get to the enemy's trench line, they've already assembled a much larger counter attack, and expel our attacking force before the support moves up. By making sure our men are prepared to move up the line quickly, we ensure we can keep what ground we get."

ww1_defence:0 "고정 진지"
ww1_defence_desc:0 "참호는 그 자체로도 유용하나, 복합적인 구조를 지닐 수록 더욱 좋아진다. 참호 전선에 장교를 위한 벙커 지역을 구성, 보급고를 전선 사이사이 분산 배치하고, 공용 신호소를 설치함으로 우리 전선을 가로질러가는 걸 악몽같이 만들 수 있다."

ww1_battlefield:0 "공세이전"
ww1_battlefield_desc:0 "간혹 최고의 방어는 훌륭한 공격이다. 그러나 때때로 최고의 방어는 적이 실수에 처했을 때다. 적이 공격하게끔 미끼를 놓은 뒤, 적을 도살해버리고 같은 방식의 공격으로 대응한다. 이로 우리는 전투에서 쉽게 공세를 진행할 수 있다."

ww1_target:0 "정확한 포위섬멸"
ww1_target_desc:0 "Trenches and fortified lines are no easy target for our troops. The wall of lead and men to fight that extends seemingly forever is almost impervious to a full frontal assault. However, if we can find the weak points in the trench line, sneak through, and attack not just from the front, but the side and back as well, we can clear enemy trenches with ease."

ww1_night:0 "종심방어"
ww1_night_desc:0 "최근 들어 공격 교리에서 많은 발전이 보였지만, 우리는 방어 교리 또한 잊고 있어서는 안 된다. 종심방어전술으로도 불리는 종심방어는 최전선 참호의 전체적인 구성을 바꾸는 기술이다. 참호에 대응 전선과 탈출로 그리고 충분한 비축물자를 둔다. 이를 통해 장기간의 공격으로 거점에서 우리 군대를 몰아내고 싶어 하는 적에게 비싼 대가를 치르도록 만든다."

ww1_armored_car:0 "대전차전"
ww1_armored_car_desc:0 "적 전차는 보병 전선을 찢어 발길 수 있으며, 심지어 거의 단독으로 행동하더라도 최소한의 방해조차 받지 않는다. 그러나 우리의 보병용 직사화기가 전차의 장갑을 박살 낼 수 있음이 우연히 증명되었고, 우리군의 평범한 수류탄 (특히 폭약과 크기가 큰 유형일수록)은 전차에 파괴적인 손상을 가해 왔다. 우리가 적 전차 대항에 이런 무기들을 집중적으로 사용한다면, 짐승들에 맞서 싸울 수 있을 것이고, 우리 병사들을 와해시키는 ‘전차 공황’을 끝낼지도 모른다."

ww1_tank:0 "중전차 지원"
ww1_tank_desc:0 "These brand new Tanks seem to be the wonder weapons to win the war. Passing through enemy trenches and nearly invulnerable to small arms fire, they're devestating machines. However, there's no doubt our enemy will eventually develop the weapons needed to take these vehicles out, so we must ensure we make the most out of these new combat vehicles by the time they lose their decisive advantage."

ww1_armored_car_and_tank:0 "기갑전"
ww1_armored_car_and_tank_desc:0 "Tanks are getting more mobile, and beginning to be able to keep pace with our other military vehicles. In addition, tanks with a proper gun are able to fight and knock out enemy tanks. We can develop the ''Cavalry Tank'' role with these developments, allowing our faster tanks backed with Armored Cars to cause havoc in the back of enemy lines."

ww1_landdoctrine_unlock_ww2:0 "이동전"
ww1_landdoctrine_unlock_ww2_desc:0 "New weapon developments like the Tank, the Sub-Machine Gun, and the Light Machine Gun have made the long trenches and stalemates of the last war almost obsolete. Even if we are to still be a defensive focused army, the future is no longer with these old doctrines and mentalities. Tomorrow's war may just make speed a priority."

# NAVAL DOCTRINES

ww1_navaldoctrine:0 "대양함대"
ww1_navaldoctrine_desc:0 "The waves are ruled by Dreadnoughts in today's naval warfare. These huge battleships are the centerpiece of almost every fleet. Obviously, our doctrine must reenforce the importance of these Capital Ships, and use our lighter vessels such as Cruisers as screens and support ships for the fleet."

ww1_navaldoctrine_2:0 "해군 수송선"
ww1_navaldoctrine_2_desc:0 "Ensuring supplies are transported across the seas is an important task. Grouping up individual ships into Convoy groups will help our ships protect themselves, have a distinct chain of command, and make sure the supplies get to our shores as quickly and seamlessly as possible."

ww1_navaldoctrine_3:0 "해군 수송선 호위"
ww1_navaldoctrine_3_desc:0 "While convoys themselves are good transportation ships, they're very weak, and easy prey for any enemy ship, especially those specifically designed as raiders. Using some of our lighter or older vessels as specific convoy escorts, designed to protect these valuable ships, will ensure that even if the dreaded Submarines show their face, our transport ships have at the very least a chance to get out in time."

ww1_navaldoctrine_4:0 "잠수함과 호흡"
ww1_navaldoctrine_4_desc:0 "Submarines are no new invention, but their use in combat is still being developed. Raiding enemy shipping seems to be where they do best, so ensuring submarine captains and crew know their role and support each other in this task could allow us to starve out our enemies outright."

ww1_navaldoctrine_5:0 "수송선 격침 중점"
ww1_navaldoctrine_5_desc:0 "Convoys are easy prey for any of our ships, and very important targets as well. Yet, as if by instinct, most of our captains prefer to fire at their escorts instead, essentially wasting time and allowing critical cargo to escape. If we drill a focus on destroying enemy cargo ships above almost all else into our doctrine, we can severely hamper our enemies' economies."

ww1_navaldoctrine_5b:0 "주력함 격침 중점"
ww1_navaldoctrine_5b_desc:0 "In the heat of battle, our captains are largely disorganized in fire. For the most part, inexperienced commanders will simply order their ships to fire at the nearest enemy vessel, which isn't always the most important target. Ensuring our fleet commanders know the priorities of enemy ships will ensure we spend more time in battles focusing on the prime pieces of the enemy fleet, and less time worrying about what enemy Destroyers are up to."

ww1_navaldoctrine_6:0 "빠른 함대 이동"
ww1_navaldoctrine_6_desc:0 "Sometimes, a fleet just needs to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible. Whether this is to escape a much larger enemy fleet, catch up to a smaller one, or simply ensure the maximum efficiency when redeploying, it's a common enough necessity to train our fleet for. Getting more knots out of even our capital ships is possible, with the right techniques and planning."

ww1_navaldoctrine_6b:0 "함대의 이동과 호흡"
ww1_navaldoctrine_6b_desc:0 "When preparing for battle, positioning of individual ships is typically what wins or loses an encounter between equal, or even nearly equal fleets. Ensuring capital ships don't meet their doom just by being at the wrong place at the wrong time (usually just too far from their screens) could save our nation several lives and ships in the long run."

ww1_navaldoctrine_unlock_ww2:0 "강력한 전투함대의 공격"
ww1_navaldoctrine_unlock_ww2_desc:0 "While Submarines and Destroyers are quite capable at dealing with enemy shipping, there is most certainly value in using larger ships for this role as well. Battlecruisers in particular could blow away not only any cargo ship, but also any escorts around it, to the bottom of the sea and are more than capable of keeping pace with these vessels. Using our capital ships as convoy raiders will greatly expand our ability to stop any enemy imports."

# AIR DOCTRINES

ww1_airdoctrine:0 "공군 부대"
ww1_airdoctrine_desc:0 "In the earliest days of air warfare, almost every encounter with enemy planes will be a simple one on one fight. However, as more and more of these flying machines join the battle, there would be a great advantage to be had in coherent groups of planes. Adopting air squadrons for our fighters will ensure that any airborne enemies will have no less than two or three pilots tracking them at any time."

ww1_airdoctrine_2:0 "비행선 폭격 훈련"
ww1_airdoctrine_2_desc:0 "Airships have been shown to be no good for fighting enemy aircraft, and thus must be tooled for bombing specifically. Ensuring that not just the pilot, but every crew member on one of our airships knows when and how to do things like open up the bomb bay and resupply it properly will ensure we make the most of this type of aircraft."

ww1_airdoctrine_3:0 "폭격 조준하기"
ww1_airdoctrine_3_desc:0 "While it's possible to manually determine where exactly a bomb is going to land mid-flight, it's not something you want to waste time doing. Ensuring that all of our bombing aircraft have accurate bombing sights, and that all of our bombing pilots know how to use them, will help all such aircraft hit their marks more often and quickly."

ww1_airdoctrine_4:0 "항공 폭탄"
ww1_airdoctrine_4_desc:0 "While any old explosive will work as a bomb, we can increase the accuracy of all of our models with the Aerial Bomb design, which will let us use innovative design changes such as the impact fuse, and, perhaps more importantly, increase the potential weight of such weapons. Supplying our pilots with these new designs as well as continuing to improve the stability and blast power of these designs will lead to direct improvements in our bombing ability."

ww1_airdoctrine_5:0 "V자 대형"
ww1_airdoctrine_5_desc:0 "Fighters in squadrons are more effective than those alone, but there are more advantages to be derived here. Utilizing the V-formation will help increase fuel efficiency, and ensure that in unexpected interception, every member of a wing is close enough to help out."

ww1_airdoctrine_5b:0 "회전폭격"
ww1_airdoctrine_5b_desc:0 "We have organized our fighters to a large degree, but our bombers still need some work. A good start is rotation- Instead of simply assigning a group of bombers a task and flying them all out there at once, we can rotate our bombers out, sending smaller groups out more consistently to keep the pressure on enemy targets. Since not all of our bombers can hit the same target at once anyway, this will be a direct increase in their capabilities."

ww1_airdoctrine_6:0 "기본적인 전투기 기동"
ww1_airdoctrine_6_desc:0 "Playing a large aerial game of chicken works against unarmed or inferior aircraft, but tailing an enemy aircraft, or simply attacking from a direction that no gun is facing, can save many of our pilots, strike fear into our enemies, and make air superiority and interception more of an efficient process."

ww1_airdoctrine_6b:0 "전략적인 폭격 활동"
ww1_airdoctrine_6b_desc:0 "Though bombs are mostly used on the battlefield itself, there are a few obvious, but largely untapped uses. For instance, an aircraft with enough of a bomb bay capacity could destroy the factories of enemies, which would give us a large, long-term advantage. Currently, our Airships seem fit to take this role."

ww1_airdoctrine_7:0 "붐 앤 줌"
ww1_airdoctrine_7_desc:0 "As Fighter aircraft evolve to be able to take higher altitudes, an interesting tactic becomes available. A high-altitude aircraft that goes into a dive will build up much higher speed, allowing it to make a safe attack on unaware aircraft, and promptly retreat back into the sky. This will be very useful for dealing with low-flying bombers, unaware fighters, or simply doing safe strafing runs."

ww1_airdoctrine_7b:0 "정밀 폭격"
ww1_airdoctrine_7b_desc:0 "Bombing is still not an exact science, but we can make strides to improve it. By adjusting bomb bays to drop bombs more consistently centered, adopting standardized weights for specific scenarios, and training our pilots on when to drop and when to reserve their payload, we can increase the efficiency of our bomber forces further."

ww1_airdoctrine_8:0 "턴 파이팅"
ww1_airdoctrine_8_desc:0 "Fighters that are more maneuverable can quickly circle an enemy to stay in their blind spot, and keep pressure on an enemy aircraft. If nothing else, this little flying circus will buy any fighter enough time to get backup, if not confuse his enemy and get an easy exit from a fight. However, if our planes get a significant maneuverability advantage, this will be a very devestating tactic to our enemies."

ww1_airdoctrine_9:0 "신속한 폭격"
ww1_airdoctrine_9_desc:0 "In times of enemy air superiority, bombing must be a quick and dirty operation. Training our light bomber pilots in quick bomb-quick exit tactics will let them do additional damage when time is of the essence, and even in normal operation, will increase the speed at which bombers can drop their payloads and return for resupply."

ww1_airdoctrine_unlock_ww2:0 "에이스 베테랑 주도"
ww1_airdoctrine_unlock_ww2_desc:0 "Some of our finer pilots are becoming celebrities of note, and are massive inspirations to the men who work in the same air squadron. These men are very valuable in air combat, and as experts to teach their fellow pilots tricks and techniques. Making sure pilots are recognized for their efforts and able to pass on these skills will vastly help our air force."
